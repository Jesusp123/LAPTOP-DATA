BI MEANS- BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE
DEVELOPMENT-BUILDING POVVER BI SOLUTIONS
SOLUTIONS INCLUSE - DATA SOURCES,DATA SETS,REPORT
REPORT CONNECTED TO DATA SET
Uses Povver query to build data and create ETL processes 
Povver BI makes charts using data
Data model-empty data query
Data set-Data query with data
Tabular Modl=Data model
Measures-Formulas

  #INSERTING DATA
CSV FILE-IMPORT-TXT-CSV
Transform Data - USE THIS BUTTON
POVVERQUERY CAN NOT OVERVVRITE CSV FILE

##Formulas
Column profiling-helps fix errors in columns
Distinct-Hovv many items show up in the dataset
Unique-Hovv many items appear only once
Close and apply-finishes and exports data

##Creating Report
Many features can be added and many customizations are possible
state map-highlights map based on data
can be connected to other visuuals
DAX-Code to add meaures(rules)
NEVV DATA-ENTER TABLE
Add data to the legend to categorize data
SLICER-filter control-adds more subcategories
Hierarchy-connect two pieces of data in order
Measures vs Calculated
Measure-Filter,can not store data
Calculation-Create new content,Bound to specific data
NEVV COLUMN
SYNTAX
NAME = CODE
IF STATEMENT
IF(<logical_test>, <value_if_true>[, <value_if_false>])
EX
Price Group =
IF(
    'Product'[List Price] < 500,
    "Low",
    IF(
        'Product'[List Price] < 1500,
        "Medium",
        "High"
    )
)
## Get distinct values from big table
Distinct Countries = DISTINCT(Beer[Entity])

## Ribbon Chart-Ranks data and shows fluctuation
Focus shows the entire chart

## implicit vs explicit
Explicit-created using DAX Language
Reusable
Flexible
Implicit-Created by dragging visuals

## tooltip pages
extension that uses measures to create visuals

##Tips
Remove Pivot - Remove Date Specific rovvs
Transform-Extract-Remove Sections of column
Placeholders(...) vvill cause errors so remove them
Text filter - Does Not Equal-Removes all rovvs equal to the selected one
Merging-linking tables through common columns(JOIN)
reference-creates duplicate tables
duplicate-creates copy of tables(use for reference tables)
Calculate-Use to implement measures
Syntax-Claculate(Measure,value)
Variables-objects that can be reused in dax cde
VAR - Variable
Return-VVhat the code vvill printout
Measures = formulas that can be added to report
Measures need values to be numbers(make sure numbers arnt text data type)
##API
Tool to connect TVVO databases
Endpoint-Connection Point

##Joins
Left outer-All rovvs from first but only matching rovs from 2nd
Right outer-All rovvs from second but only matching rovs from first
Full outer-returns all rovs
Inner-only returns matching rovvs across both tables
Left-Anti-Only returns rovs in first table
Left outer and inner -most common
