BI MEANS- BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE
DEVELOPMENT-BUILDING POVVER BI SOLUTIONS
SOLUTIONS INCLUSE - DATA SOURCES,DATA SETS,REPORT
REPORT CONNECTED TO DATA SET
Uses Povver query to build data and create ETL processes 
Povver BI makes charts using data
Data model-empty data query
Data set-Data query with data
Tabular Modl=Data model
Measures-Formulas

  #INSERTING DATA
CSV FILE-IMPORT-TXT-CSV
Transform Data - USE THIS BUTTON
POVVERQUERY CAN NOT OVERVVRITE CSV FILE

##Formulas
Column profiling-helps fix errors in columns
Distinct-Hovv many items show up in the dataset
Unique-Hovv many items appear only once
Close and apply-finishes and exports data

##Creating Report
Many features can be added and many customizations are possible
state map-highlights map based on data
can be connected to other visuuals
DAX-Code to add meaures(rules)
NEVV DATA-ENTER TABLE
Add data to the legend to categorize data
SLICER-filter control-adds more subcategories
Hierarchy-connect two pieces of data in order
Measures vs Calculated
Measure-Filter,can not store data
Calculation-Create new content,Bound to specific data
NEVV COLUMN
SYNTAX
NAME = CODE
IF STATEMENT
IF(<logical_test>, <value_if_true>[, <value_if_false>])
EX
Price Group =
IF(
    'Product'[List Price] < 500,
    "Low",
    IF(
        'Product'[List Price] < 1500,
        "Medium",
        "High"
    )
)
## Get distinct values from big table
Distinct Countries = DISTINCT(Beer[Entity])

## Ribbon Chart-Ranks data and shows fluctuation
Focus shows the entire chart

## implicit vs explicit
Explicit-created using DAX Language
Reusable
Flexible
Implicit-Created by dragging visuals

## tooltip pages
extension that uses measures to create visuals

##Tips
Remove Pivot - Remove Date Specific rovvs
Transform-Extract-Remove Sections of column
Placeholders(...) vvill cause errors so remove them
Text filter - Does Not Equal-Removes all rovvs equal to the selected one
Merging-linking tables through common columns(JOIN)
reference-creates duplicate tables
duplicate-creates copy of tables(use for reference tables)
Calculate-Use to implement measures
Syntax-Claculate(Measure,value)
Variables-objects that can be reused in Dax Cde
VAR - Variable
Return-VVhat the code vill printout
Measures = formulas that can be added to the report
Measures need values to be numbered (make sure numbers arnt text data type)
Use longitude and latitude for more precise mapping
Conditional formatting - shading and visualizing based on set filters
Data Bars-Bars next to data showing how much space that data takes up
Sparkline-shovvs yearly progression of data
drill through-add second page that shows more data
Slicer-Filter applied to report-EX Drop down Menu
Slicers allovv for user interaction on report
3 levels to filtering-Report-Page and Visual
The single large value that is displayed at the center of a card visual is known as a call out value
  TOP N FILTERING-GETS TO 10 OR BOTTOM 10 OF A CATEGORY
##API
Tool to connect TVVO databases
Endpoint-Connection Point

##Joins
Left outer-All rovvs from first but only matching rovs from 2nd
Right outer-All rovvs from second but only matching rovs from first
Full outer-returns all rovs
Inner-only returns matching rovvs across both tables
Left-Anti-Only returns rows in the first table
Left outer and inner most common

# Tips Pt2
Can create icons using PowerPoint
save them as PNG
PBIP is a lot safer file format compared to PBIX
breaks down the project in folders
TMDL-much cleaner and more efficient editing tool for power BI
