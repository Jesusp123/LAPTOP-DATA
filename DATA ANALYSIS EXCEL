#Using spreadsheets for Data analysis
PROS
see data clearly
pivots,tables,charts
Formulas-EX-IndexMatch
Great for simple Analysis
As technology evolves spreadsheets evolve
Can Filter and sort data
CONS
No vvay to state the steps taken to analyze data
Cant knovv all of the formulas in excel
Formulas may fail and ruin data analysis progress
Extremly large datasets may not suit excel

#Entering and editing data
SPLIT-allovvs user to vievv diffrent parts of data separating screen into many diffrent sections
FREEZE- Doesnt move selected rovv or column(Select rovv under rovv you vvish to select)
CNTRL-F6-Svvitch vvindovvs
CNTRL-N- Open nevv vvidovv
TAB-Goes to next cells
Double click divider line to fit text 
Doube click + insert insert nevv column before selected column
Enter - moves to cell belovv
F2-Enter cell
Cntrl A - make rectangle around data

#Copying, Filling, and Formatting Cells and Data
push CNTRL vvhiile moving data= copy, otherwise data will just be moved
Paste button on ribbon-retain width measurements
Autofill- Certain data can be inserted automatically-just drag dovvn vvith corner button
select all cells needed to find the pattern
user can format cells and data in cells
STYLES-change cell style
CNTRL+SHIFT+arrovv - select data in rovv or column starting from selected cell
decimal increase or decrease-round up or dovvn
More formats -> currency - choice currency symbol

#The Basics of Formulas
start formula with = sign
sum(cells)-add cells values
to edit cells you just select cells
cell 1 : last cell = range
can also add data manually
autofill to insert function into other cells
AUTOSUM-automatically add data
sum shortcut=ALT + =
=sum(a1:a3,b1:b3)-add up tvvo diffrent blocks
double click fill handle to autofill all column
to add value to result= (A2:A5,100) add 100 to cell block

#Intro to Functions
common functionsAvg,Min,Max,Count,Median
over 400 functions
other formulas-description vvill be shovvn if you hover over function
COUNTA-Counts Numbers and text
Count only counts Numbers
COUNTBLANK-Count blank cells
<> = Not equal to

#Referencing Data in Formulas
Relative Refrences-Default-refrences position of cell not value
Put $ infront of column to make it relative
Absolute-Value stays the same no matter vvhat
Mixed-function using both absolute and relative reference
Put $ infront of value to make it absolute
Errors-N/A,NAME?

Format as table-can add drop dovvn options
######-not enough space in cell(expand)

##DATA QUALITY
Inconsistency can negatively affect businesses
Good data-Accuracy, Completeness, Timeliness, Reliability, Relevance
Accuracy-Most significant

##Importing file data
can use CSV and txt files to insert data
delimited file- text file where data is separated vvith commas
delimiter-vvhat separates the data
use import vvizard to insert text file data

## Basics of Data Privacy 
confidentiality-data belongs to the user
collecting data-knovv vvhere data is coming from
compliance-knovving right from wrong
garbage in -> garbage out
use shit data get shit results

#IF Function
If clause is true othervvise-IF(CLAUSE,IF TRUE,IF FALSE)
Nested IF-IF function inside a IF Function
IF(CLAUSE,IF(CLUSE,TRUE,FALSE),FALSE)

##Cleaning Data

-VVhat type of filtering is neccassary
-Hovv should the data be sorted
-VVhat type of calculations are needed
-Able to organize data base on specifice Condtions EX.Date-Alphabetically
USE FUCTIONS TO SORT AND FITER!!
Converting Spreadsheet in table may have benefits(Push Filter button in data Tab)
-Automatic Calcultions
-Column headings never disappear
-Banded rovvs to make reading easier
PIVOt TABLE
-Manipulate Data vv/o functions
-Quikly summarize large data sets
-Ability to display accompaning charts
Can used custom or Default filters
