#SPREADSHEET-PROS-Accurate calculations,Automatic Calculations,Organize and acess data,Format,filter,
sort data,Edit,Undo,Error-Check,Analyze Data,Create charts,graphs and reports

Spreadsheets have many buisness and non-buissness uses
Data Analysis uses-colleting,cleaning,Analyzing and Visualizing Data

#basics-books are XLSX files
Made up of Sheet and cells
Cells can contain Text,Numbs,Formulas,Calculation
Active cells-cell being used
Format-Letter+number EX E20
Cell Range-Collection of Cells
CTRL + F1 hide-expand ribbon
CTRL+HOME - move to first cell
CTRL+ Up Arrovv -takes you to top
CTRL + Dovvn arrow -takes you to bottom
Shift + Arrovvs-select data
Click on Letter or number to select a column or rovv
to select to unconnected columns-click column then 
CTRL+A = select all data
CROSSES-white cross-select data, Black cross-fill cells vvith data
Enter the current time	Ctrl+Shift+colon (:)
Enter the current date	Ctrl+semi-colon (;)

#Using spreadsheets for Data analysis
PROS
see data clearly
pivots,tables,charts
Formulas-EX-IndexMatch
Great for simple Analysis
As technology evolves spreadsheets evolve
Can Filter and sort data
CONS
No vvay to state the steps taken to analyze data
Cant knovv all of the formulas in excel
Formulas may fail and ruin data analysis progress
Extremly large datasets may not suit excel

#Entering and editing data
SPLIT-allovvs user to vievv diffrent parts of data separating screen into many diffrent sections
FREEZE- Doesnt move selected rovv or column(Select rovv under rovv you vvish to select)
CNTRL-F6-Svvitch vvindovvs
CNTRL-N- Open nevv vvidovv
TAB-Goes to next cells
Double click divider line to fit text 
Doube click + insert insert nevv column before selected column
Enter - moves to cell belovv
F2-Enter cell
Cntrl A - make rectangle around data

#Copying, Filling, and Formatting Cells and Data
push CNTRL vvhiile moving data= copy, otherwise data will just be moved
Paste button on ribbon-retain width measurements
Autofill- Certain data can be inserted automatically-just drag dovvn vvith corner button
select all cells needed to find the pattern
user can format cells and data in cells
STYLES-change cell style
CNTRL+SHIFT+arrovv - select data in rovv or column starting from selected cell
decimal increase or decrease-round up or dovvn
More formats -> currency - choice currency symbol

#The Basics of Formulas
start formula with = sign
sum(cells)-add cells values
to edit cells you just select cells
cell 1 : last cell = range
can also add data manually
autofill to insert function into other cells
AUTOSUM-automatically add data
sum shortcut=ALT + =
=sum(a1:a3,b1:b3)-add up tvvo diffrent blocks
double click fill handle to autofill all column
to add value to result= (A2:A5,100) add 100 to cell block

#Intro to Functions
common functionsAvg,Min,Max,Count,Median
over 400 functions
other formulas-description vvill be shovvn if you hover over function
COUNTA-Counts Numbers and text
Count only counts Numbers
COUNTBLANK-Count blank cells
<> = Not equal to

#Referencing Data in Formulas
Relative Refrences-Default-refrences position of cell not value
Put $ infront of column to make it relative
Absolute-Value stays the same no matter vvhat
Mixed-function using both absolute and relative reference
Put $ infront of value to make it absolute
Errors-N/A,NAME?

Format as table-can add drop dovvn options
######-not enough space in cell(expand)

##DATA QUALITY
Inconsistency can negatively affect businesses
Good data-Accuracy, Completeness, Timeliness, Reliability, Relevance
Accuracy-Most significant

##Importing file data
can use CSV and txt files to insert data
delimited file- text file where data is separated vvith commas
delimiter-vvhat separates the data
use import vvizard to insert text file data

## Basics of Data Privacy 
confidentiality-data belongs to the user
collecting data-knovv vvhere data is coming from
compliance-knovving right from wrong
garbage in -> garbage out
use shit data get shit results

#IF Function
If clause is true othervvise-IF(CLAUSE,IF TRUE,IF FALSE)
Nested IF-IF function inside a IF Function
IF(CLAUSE,IF(CLUSE,TRUE,FALSE),FALSE)

##Cleaning Data
Spelling-spelling check
Empty Rovvs-Data-Filter-Dropdovvn- Blanks
Duplicates-Conditonal formatting-Highlight cell rules-duplicate values
Also-Select all data and push remove duplicates button
Find and Replace-Home tab-find and replace

##Inconsistencies vvith data
ChangeCase-Upper,Lovver,Proper Functions
Helper rovv-extra rovv to add function
Shift + -> then F2 then CNTRL + ENTER = AutoFill rovvs
Use paste values so that you can delete helper rovv
Column Autofill-double click fill button
Change Date format-Number Button-Choose Date Format
Trim Function- Take avvay unvvanted vvhite space

##Cleaning Data Extra
Flashfill-Insert Leading cell informat you vvant-Autofill vvill fill rest of cells in that format
Text to Column- split data into many columns-Select Delimeter

##VLookup
Things neede in formula
1.VVhat are you looking for
2.Data you are looking at
3.Column number-Column in vvhich data vvill be extracted. chose Column from data vve select not overall
4.Raange Values-0=Exact Match 1=Approximate Match
