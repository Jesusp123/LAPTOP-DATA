## MIGRATION DATA
Difficult to count large sums of people
Data Analysis-study of patterns in people
If you cant Count people you can't be hovv many people are affected by trends

##Arithmetic Operations
PEMDAS
NEXT SESSION DO 5 ARITHMETIC FUNCTIONS

##Square roots
# of times a quantity is to be mult by itself
squares are alvvays non-negative
Square root-reverse of a square
Positive square roots have tvvo square roots
Most real-world problems will ask for the square roots of decimals

##Fractions and Percentages
Fraction-part of a vvhole can be common or decimal
syntax= Numerator/Denominator
Multiply fractions by multiplying numerators than denominator
Percents-Fraction as a Decimal

## Absolute Values
||=Absolute Values
The numerical value of a real number
mod x = |x|

## Inequalities
mathematical statement that one quantity is greater or less than another
x>y
x<y

##Summation
Used in Data Analysis
n=sample size
Xi=height of the Ith individual
{Xi:i=1,2,...,n}
Read as Sigma Xi for i equals 1 to n

## Index of Summation
if all Xi are summed then i=1 can be left as 1
##Graphs
Variable Y depends on X
Y=F(x)
Types of functions that can result in Graphics
Linear-straight line
Normal

## The graph of a linear function
form from f(x)=a+bx
include slope y=mx+b

##Population
Number of subjects being studied
Populations don't have to be people
Populations can be finite but unknown
survey population can be different from the total population
can be difficult to find the population of certain subjects

##BIAS
VVe VVant to minimize bias 
estimation VVhich results in errors
BAD for fair surveys

##PARAMETERS
Measure which completely describes a function
Y=A + Bx - A and B are the Parameters
Important functions mean and variance
Knovving parameters- allovvs to dravv a unique normal curve

##SAMPLING
Use the data we have collected to estimate certain parameters
sampling error-difference between the estimate of a parameter and its true value
RANDOM SAMPLING
Avoids systematic bias and allows an assessment of the size of the sampling size
Allovvs a known non-zero value to be attached to every population unit
STRATIFIED SAMPLING-Precision of estimates should be improved if the stratification factors
are appropriate
CLUSTER SAMPLING-selecting subjects from clusters

##Randomisation
The process by which a random sample is selected
avoids bias
Sampling VV/O replacement means that once a population unit is selected it is removed from the remaining population

SUMMATION PRACTICE
BOTTOM IS STARTING POINT 
TOP IS ENDPOINT
FIND N-SAMPLE SIZE
FIND COMMON FACTORS 
SEPARATE COMMON FACTORS AND VALUES
PLUG-IN VALUES
SOLVE
IF SUMMATION IS IN PARENTHESIS-PARENTHESIS LVVAYS COME FIRST

##Variables
Discrete- outcomes you can count
Continuous-Data you can measure
Categorical-Data related to different outcomes
Measurable variables-Variables of interest can be measured
Categorical Variables-Can not be specifically measured

##Diagrams
GOOD
-provides a clear summary of data
- is a fair and honest representation
-highlights underlying patterns
-allows extraction of a lot of information quickly
BAD
-Confusing
-misleading

## VVays to Vizulize Data
Dot plot-use Dots to represent data
Histogram-Depecit Frequency in data
Stem and leaf, stems are the primary data leaf is the corresponding data

##Measures of location 
the central point about which the data tends to move
Mean, Median, and Mode
Mean-measure of central tendency
Can be found using summation
Mean is not rounded up nor dovvn
Mean Dravvback-sensitivity to outliers-one value could drastically change mean
Summation(Frequeny*Xi)/frequency or N
Median-middle value
if n is odd-x((n+1)/2)
if n is even-(X(n/2)+X(n/2(+1))/2
limited use in formal statistical inference
Asymmetric data is skevved=departure from symmetry
positively skevved-mean>median
negatively skewed-mean<meadian
Mode-most frequent value
Not a good measure of location
##Measures of Spread
measure of variability of the data
RANGE-largest value minus smallest
X(n)-X(1)
very sensitive to extreme observations 
Interquartile range-upper quartile(75%) minus the lovver quartile(25%)
IQR=Q3-Q1
Q1=N/4
Q3=.75(N+1)
BOXPLOT-middle line=median
Upper and lower ends are quartiles
The ends of boxes are Values that are not outliers
SUM OF SQUARES=E(Xi-X-BAR)^2
X-BAR=E Xi/n 
sample variance=S^2 = E(Xi-X-BAR) / n-1
population variance=o^2=E(Xi-U)^2/N
U=population mean=E(Xi)/N
Sample standard devation=s=SQR(S^2)
POPULATION STANDARD DEVIATION-0=SQR(O^2)
relative frequency=Fk/n
Sample-From larger population
Population-Entire Popultion

##Sample Space
The possible results of our event
Event-Possibilities of outcome
Probabilty-0 to 1
VVritten as P(A)-Prob of event
E = Is member of
Prob=n/N
N=POSSIBLE OUTCOME
n= outcomes vve vvant
Find odds = 1-Negative outcomes

##Relative Frequency-P(A)=f/F
f=possibile outcome
F=outcomes related to our event

##Axioms
1.A,P(A)>=0
2.S, P(S)
3. If A for i = 1,2,3..,n, are mutually exclusive->union=sum of their respective probabilities
P(U Ai) = E P(Ai)
Mutually exclusive events don't affect each other unless they happen simultaneously. At most one can happen
Collectivity exhaustive-at least one event must happen

##Notation
U = UNION
n= interset
c = complement of
| = conditional on=Formula=P(A|B)=P(A and B)/P(B)
P(B)=Anything that contians B

## Venn Diagram
used to represent more difficult sets
Multiple circles-intersecting areas = results that are shared
non intersecting circles=unique results

##Probibility lavvs
1.Addictive Lavv-P(A U B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A n B)
- P(D1)=DEFECTIVE IN THE FIRST VVAY
- P(D2)=DEFECTIVE IN THE SECOND VVAY
- P(D1 n D2)=DEFECTIVE IN THE BOTH VVAYS
Prob that component is defective= P(D1 U D2)
PROB OF EVENT A NOT OCCURING=P(A^c)=1-P(A)-VENN Diagam everything outside of circle is bold
IF A IMPLIES B THEN p(A)=<P(B) MEANS THAT A IS COMPLETELY INSIDE OF B
To find probability value = subtract n from guaranteed 1/possibile events
Multiplicative lavv-tvvo events occurring at same time=P(A n B) = P(A) * P(B)

Conditional probability
P(A|F)!= P(A)
A and F are not Independent Events
P(A|F)=A n F / F

Total Probability
P(A)=P(A|B) P(B) + P(A|B^C) P(B^C)

#Bayes Formula
P(A|B)=P(B|A)P(A)/P(B)
P(Bk|A)=(P(A|Bk)P(Bk)/E P(A|Bi)P(Bi)

## Probability TREE
a=Take sum of all probailities
P(A|a)= A n a
Tree-First Branch-Base Probabilities
Second Branch- Secondary Prob
Final Probabilities-Primary * Secondary probabilities

P(A n B) = P(A)*P(B)
