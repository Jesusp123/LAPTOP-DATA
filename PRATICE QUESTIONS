#1Mention the differences between Data Mining and Data Profiling
DATA MINING-process of discovering relevant information that has not yet been identified before,raw data is converted into valuable information
DATA PROFILING-evaluate a dataset for its uniqueness, logic, and consistency,cannot identify inaccurate or incorrect data values.

#2 Define the term 'Data Wrangling in Data Analytics
 process wherein raw data is cleaned, structured, and enriched into a desired usable format for better decision making

#3What are the various steps involved in any analytics project
1.Finding out the question you VVant to ansvver
2.Collecting data
3.Cleaning data
4.Analyzing Data
5.Find patterns,insights and future trends

#4. What are the common problems that data analysts encounter during analysis?
1.Using duplicaate data
2.Not collecting meaniful data
3.Not securing personal data

#6. What are the best methods for data cleaning
1. Inspecting Data
2. Getting rid of duplicates
3.cross-validation
4. Normalize data at the entry point

# 7. Wh
at is the significance of Exploratory Data Analysis 
1.helps you obtain confidence in your data
2. allows you to refine your selection of feature variables
3. can discover hidden trends and
insights from the data.

#8. Explain descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.
Descriptive-provides insights into the past to answer “what has happened”,Uses data aggregation and data mining techniques
Predictive-Understands the future to answer “what could happen”,Uses statistical models and forecasting techniques
Prescriptive- Suggest various courses of action to answer “what should you do”,Uses simulation algorithms and optimization techniques to advise possible outcomes

Simple random sampling
Systematic sampling
Cluster sampling
Stratified sampling
Judgmental or purposive sampling

#10.Describe univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis
univariate-data analysis where the data being analyzed contains only one variable. 
bivariate-analysis of two variables to find causes, relationships, and correlations between the variables. 
multivariate- analysis of three or more variables to understand the relationship of each variable with the other variables

#11.What are your strengths and weaknesses as a data analyst?
Strengths-strong analytical skills, attention to detail, proficiency in data manipulation and visualization
VVeakness-limited domain knowledge, lack of experience with certain data analysis tools or techniques
